TaskMaster Final Project

	I have created a rough outline of the window arrangement for my TaskMaster application. It includes a title, a short instruction label, an input field, a list box, and the buttons required to add and complete tasks to the list box as well as save and load them. I am currently trying to understand the list box documentation so I can add inputs from the task input field to the list. From there, I plan to write functions for the save and load buttons to write and read from a file. My next step after that is to add a button that displays a second window showing tasks that have been marked completed.
